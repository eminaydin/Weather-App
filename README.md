## The Project
Simple weather app made by using React. As it is originally designed for mobile devices, its better to resize your window to have better UI experience. Basically, there is a single input field and as user types a city name, weather forecast of that place in that specific date will be fetched and displayed to user. I've decided to not overload the screen with too much data, that's why only the basic information about the forecast will be visible.

I've also implemented dynamically changing background. Depending on the weather, if its cold or warm or even cloudy, background image will be changed to something represents that weather.

## Challenges

I didn't had a struggle in this project as this was a single page, basic structured application. I particularly liked the idea of changing the background image according to weather to have some dynamism in the app.
